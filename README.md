## Questions

## FAQ

### I've already submitted my idea on blueprintUE Feedback page before. Is it gone?

It is migrated over to the GitHub issue tracker in this repo. You can comment on the suggestion and we will properly attribute it to you with a link to your GitHub profile.

### How quickly will you implement my suggestion?

Timeframes vary and we are unable to directly commit to any specific deadline after submission. That said, we will update the idea with the appropriate status once we have more details.

### How do I show support about ideas?

You can take advantage of GitHub reactions. Simply open the issue, and add a reaction.

The added benefit to this is we also see how many people don't like a feature, compared to those that want it implemented - this allows us to design better functionality.
